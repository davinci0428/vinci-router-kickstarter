# Vinci Router Kickstarter
This is a React based sample implementation of a routing system I call **Vinci Router**. The implementation is simple enough that you should be able to understand how the router works by running and examining the code. There will be no further development of this repository.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
